                        <p>1. You agree not to copy, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute or publicly display any content (except for your own information) from the service without our prior written permission.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>2. You acknowledge that all present and future copyright and other intellectual property rights subsisting in, or used in connection with, the website or any part of it (the "rights"), including the manner in which the website is presented or appears and all information and documentation relating to it is our property (or that of our licensors), and nothing in these terms shall be taken to transfer any of the rights to you.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>3. Solely for the purposes of accessing the website and placing orders we hereby grant to you, for the period during which the website is made available to you, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, licence to use the rights.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>4. You may not link to the website, other than to the url:www.umlautbrand.com, without our prior written consent.</p>
                        <br />

                        <p className='pt-8 md:text-2xl'>The order processes</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>1. You may select items from our range of products, details of which will be added to the "shopping bag" by clicking on the 'add to shopping cart' button. By clicking on the 'proceed to checkout' button, you initiate the checkout process for the products added to the shopping cart. By clicking on the 'pay now' button you submit an offer to buy the products in the shopping cart and agree to pay for those items. Before placing an order you can view and amend your order details at any time by clicking on the 'shopping cart & checkout' button.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>2. When you place your order to purchase products from the website, we will automatically send you an email confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "confirmation email"). We recommend that you print out the confirmation email and keep it for your own records. The confirmation email does not constitute our acceptance of your order; it merely records the fact that we have received the order.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>3. We will send you a second email when we dispatch your products which shall constitute our acceptance of your order (the "acceptance email"), at which point a binding contract of sale will be concluded between you and us.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>4. Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in an acceptance email do not form part of that contract. If for any reason the products ordered by you are not available at the time you place your order, we will notify you of this by email. Our acceptance of your order in the acceptance email is limited to the products that are available - no contract of sale will be concluded in respect of products that are not available. We will retain the title in the products until full payment has been received by us.</p>
                        <br />

                        <p className='pt-8 md:text-2xl'>Payment</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>1. Payment for your products must be made via credit or debit card, internet banking, or other means as specified on the payment page.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>2. The full payment price, including delivery charges and any additional charges for services you may have ordered, will be debited from your card or account before the order is accepted by us.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>3. You confirm that the credit or debit card or internet banking account that is being used is yours. All credit or debit card holders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by the card issuer. If the issuer of your card refuses to authorise payment we will not accept your order and we will not be responsible for any delay or non-delivery and we are not obliged to inform you of the reason for the refusal.</p>
                        <br />
                        <p>4. When you visit the website or send emails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. We will communicate with you by email or by posting notices on the website. For contractual purposes, you consent to receive communications from us electronically and you agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. This condition does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
